Since I'm not a lawyer, I don't know where to put copyrigth notices
and permission notices of softwares I use. Consequently I put them here in
hope it's sufficient.... 

Note: 

  For version 4.0, the clause for commercial software in the STk
  license has been deleted.  That means that you can make a commercial
  product which uses STk without asking me permission to do so, as it
  was required before.  The idea of this clause was not to restrict
  commercial applications but rather to count them. However, it seems
  that this clause was more harmful than useful. Anyway, if you make a
  commercial product which uses STk, it would be kind to tell me so.
