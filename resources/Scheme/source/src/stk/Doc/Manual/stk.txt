       ssttkk interpreter accepts several command-line options which
       may be abbreviated, as long as the abbreviation  is  unam­
       biguous  (e.g.  --hh,  --hhee, --hheell are three possibe abbrevia­
       tions for the --hheellpp option).


       --ccoolloorrmmaapp nneeww  Specifies that the window should have a new
                      private   colormap  instead  of  using  the
                      default colormap for the screen.

       --ddiissppllaayy _d_i_s_p_l_a_y
                      Display (and screen) on  which  to  display
                      window.

       --ffiillee _f_i_l_e_N_a_m_e Read  commands  from  _f_i_l_e_N_a_m_e  rather than
                      standard input.  The last element in  _f_i_l_e_­
                      _N_a_m_e  will  be  used  as  the title for the
                      application and name of its interpreter for
                      sseenndd  commands  (unless  overridden  by the
                      --nnaammee option).

       --ggeeoommeettrryy _g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y
                      Initial geometry to use for window.

       --nnaammee _n_a_m_e     Use _n_a_m_e as the title to  be  displayed  in
                      the  window,  and as the name of the inter­
                      preter for sseenndd commands.

       --ssyynncc          Execute  all   X   server   commands   syn­
                      chronously,  so  that  errors  are reported
                      immediately.   This  will  result  in  much
                      slower  execution,  but  it  is  useful for
                      debugging.

       --vviissuuaall _v_i_s_u_a_l Specifies the visual to use  for  the  win­
                      dow._V_i_s_u_a_l  may  be  one  of the following:

       --nnoo--ttkk         Don't initialize the Tk toolkit

       --llooaadd _f_i_l_e_N_a_m_e Evaluate expressions contained in  _f_i_l_e_N_a_m_e

       --iimmaaggee _f_i_l_e_N_a_m_e

                      _d_u_m_p  primitive  (Note: For now, _d_u_m_p works
                      only on SunOS 4.1.x, Linux 1.x (a.out  for­
                      mat) and FreeBSD).

       --cceellllss _n_u_m_b_e_r  Set the default size for the heap to _n_u_m_b_e_r
                      cells. The given number is also the  amount
                      of  cells  used  when  extending  the heap.
                      Default value is 20000.

       --iinntteerraaccttiivvee   Tell the interpreter that it is used inter­

                      them.   This provides a mechanism for pass­

                      instead of having wwiisshh interpret them.

       SSttkk  is  a  Scheme R4RS interpreter which provide a simple
       access to the X11 Tk toolkit. If the --nnoo--ttkk option is pro­
       vided  to  the interpreter, the Tk library is not initial­
       ized and no main window is created.   If  ssttkk  is  invoked
       with  no --ff option then it reads Scheme expressions inter­
       actively from standard input.  It will continue processing
       commands until all windows have been deleted or until end-
       of-file is reached on standard input.


       SSnnooww is a _l_i_g_h_t version of the ssttkk interpreter which  does
       not  provide  support for the Tk toolkit. This interpreter
       does not recognize the options --ddiissppllaayy, --ggeeoommeettrryy,  --ssyynncc
       --ccoolloorrmmaapp,  --vviissuuaall and --nnoo--ttkk which are meaningless with­
       out Tk. This interpreter is called, rather than the  stan­
       dard  one, when the shell DISPLAY variable is not initial­
       ized.


       If the --ffiillee option is provided  to  Tk,  then  ssttkk  reads
       Scheme  forms  from  the  file  named in the --ffiillee option.
       These forms will normally create an interactive  interface
       consisting  of  one  or more widgets.  When the end of the

       command file is reached, ssttkk will continue to respond to X
       events until all windows have been deleted.

       NNoottee:: The --ffiillee exits for compatibility reasons and can be
       eventually ommited. In there is no --ffiillee option used,  the
       first argument in the command line is taken as the name of
       the script file  to  execute.  To  launch  an  interactive
       script with an argument, you have to use the ---- option.

       The --iinntteerraaccttiivvee option forces the interpreter in interac­
       tive mode. In this  mode,  standard  output  and  standard
       error are unbuffered.  Use this option when you launch ssttkk
       from eemmaaccss.



VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
       Following Scheme variables are set when SSttkk starts:

       **aarrggcc**         Contains a count of the number of _a_r_g argu­
                      ments   (0  if  none),  not  including  the
                      options described above.

       **aarrggvv**         Contains a Scheme list whose  elements  are
                      the   _a_r_g   arguments  (not  including  the
                      options described above), in order,  or  an
                      empty list if there are no _a_r_g arguments.

       **pprrooggrraamm--nnaammee** Contains _f_i_l_e_N_a_m_e if it was provided (in a
                      --ffiillee  option  or  as first argument of the
                      command  line).   Otherwise,  contains  the
                      name  by which the interpreter was invoked.



SSCCRRIIPPTT FFIILLEESS
       If you create a STk script in a file whose first line is

              ##!!//uussrr//llooccaall//bbiinn//ssttkk --ff

       then you can invoke the script  file  directly  from  your
       shell if you mark it as executable.  This assumes that ssttkk
       has  been   installed   in   the   default   location   in
       /usr/local/bin;   if  it's  installed  somewhere else then
       you'll have to modify the above line to match.  Note  that
       --ff  which was necessary with pre-4.0 versions of SSTTkk is no
       more necessary and can be omitted.

       _S_T_K___L_O_A_D___P_A_T_H  This  variable  serves  to  initialize  the
