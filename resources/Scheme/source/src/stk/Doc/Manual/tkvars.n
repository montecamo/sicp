.SH NAME
tkvars \- Variables used or set by Tk
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The following STk variables are either set or used by Tk at various times
in its execution:
.TP
\fB*tk-patch-level*\fR
Contains a string which represent the current patch level for Tk.
The patch level is incremented for each new release or patch, and
it uniquely identifies an official version of Tk.
.TP
\fB*tk-strict-motif*\fR
This variable is set to \fB#f\fR by default.
If an application sets it to a true value, then Tk attempts to adhere as
closely as possible to Motif look-and-feel standards.
For example, active elements such as buttons and scrollbar
sliders will not change color when the pointer passes over them.
.TP 15
\fB*tk-version*\fR 
Tk sets this variable in the interpreter for each
application.  The value of this variable is a string which holds the
current version number of the Tk library in the form
\fImajor\fR.\fIminor\fR.  \fIMajor\fR and \fIminor\fR are integers.
The major version number increases in any Tk release that includes
changes that are not backward compatible (i.e. whenever existing Tk
applications and scripts may have to change to work with the new
release).  The minor version number increases with each new release of
Tk, except that it resets to zero whenever the major version number
changes.
