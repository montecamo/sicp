9. Commands at breakpoints.
11. Stepping mode.
17. Handle the "load" function properly in instrumented files.
20. Don't print redundant backtrace in Emacs mode?
28. Remove highlighting when debugging finished or interrupted.
29. Do proper reset when reloading files when debugger is in the middle

30. Why does error throw away so many frames (debugging Scheme-0 evaluator)?
32. Make it less easy to accidentally exit the debugger.
33. Allow breakpoints on symbols and self-evaluating constructs?
