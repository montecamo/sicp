
Important information on recompiling the UCB Scheme distribution for Windows:

0. To recompile the installation, use Visual Studio 6.0a and Visual C++.

1. You should unpack the distribution in C:\TEMP, so that the stk source root
directory is C:\TEMP\stk and the workspace is in C:\TEMP\stk\Win32\STk.dsw.
(If you put it in a different directory, things will break -- you will get a
"Error executing c:\winnt\system32\cmd.exe" at the end of the build.)

2. Make sure there exists the file stk/Src/stkvers.h.  If it doesn't exist,
you will get errors regarding "cannot open include file stkvers.h". The way to
fix this is to create a file stkvers.h in stk/Src with the single line:

#define STK_VERSION "4.0.1-ucb1.16"

Also, make sure there exists the file stk/VERSION, containing just "4.0.1".

3. Once you have unpacked everything, double-click on STk.dsw, and Visual C++
will open up. Use the "Rebuild All" option in the "Build" menu.

4. The program will NOT run until you run the install script, though. Here's
how:

4.1. You must install the Cygwin utilities (available from http://cygwin.com)
to run the install script.

4.2. Make sure your version of Cygwin has zip and unzip. Most newer versions
do. If it doesn't, you must install the Info-ZIP utilities (command-line unzip
and zip, available from ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/infozip/WIN32) to run the
install script. I installed these in the cygwin /usr/local/bin directory
(C:\cygwin\usr\local\bin\unzip.exe, for example).

4.3. OBSOLETE: Copy envdraw-1.3.tar.gz and slib2c7.zip to the stk/brg directory, if they
aren't there already.

4.4. cd to the main stk directory (C:\TEMP\stk) and run the installation script.  It takes
one argument, which is the name of the installation directory.  Public
distributions should usually use "C:/Program Files/STk" (with *forward*
slashes; these will be corrected as necessary by the install scripts.)  For
example:

  administrator@CELES$ bash brg/win-inst.sh "C:/Program Files/STk"

Or, at your option, you can use a different installation directory.  Just be
sure it's clear to the user.

5. The script will show some output like the following:

cp: Tk/tk.h: No such file or directory
cp: Tk/tkInt.h: No such file or directory
cp: Mp/fgmp-1.05b/gmp.h: No such file or directory
cp: Lib/Images/CVS: omitting directory
Archive:  c:/temp/stk/brg/slib2c7.zip

patching file `view-updates.stk'
patching file `view.stk'
installing envdraw wrapper in C:/Program Files/STk/MS-Win32/envdraw.bat
patching file `init.stk'
*** Installation completed in C:/Program Files/STk

6. To complete the final step, make a zip file containing the STk directory
and place it on the web site somewhere obvious.
